poetry-generator
================

A Python3 based Backus-Naur poetry generator.

This program works on the basis that every word in the English language is either "positive" or "negative." For instance "lovely" is positive and "thorn" is negative. A "poem" is a group of sentences that are structured in a way to have +1, -1 or 0 in terms of the positivity/negativity.  A "mushy poem" is strictly positive.
